Notee
---

I found this project while perusing r/coolgithubprojects and it is pretty neat.  It sends a notification
when a cli command finishes so you can work on other things while a command runs in the background.

Install
* `brew install yoannmoinet/brews/notee`

Project
* https://github.com/yoannmoinet/notee
