Lately I've learned the beauty of `lsof`.  At my company, when oncall, often
you get disk space alerts.  We've taken care of a lot of it with log rotation
but we still get a few disk space alerts across all environments per day.

I recently learned about `sudo lsof | grep deleted` to find files held open
by processes that have been deleted.  Once you have this list sometimes you can
find a large file and zero it out with `> /proc/<process-id>/fd/<# of file handler>`
i.e as root run `> /proc/22508/fd/3`

You can find further notes on this on my github cheat sheet for disk space:
