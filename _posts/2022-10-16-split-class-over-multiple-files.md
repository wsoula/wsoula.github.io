Lately I've been doing more python development within cdk and cdktf and errbot, but I'm not a formally trained developer.
I'm not sure if this is true or not but for an errbot plugin I only have one class.  I don't know how to add
more classes and I wanted to split my plugin over multiple files so I found this blog on how to have a class
over multiple files:
